Minesweeper
===

The game of Minesweeper built in JavaScript.

## Setup

In order to build and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependancies
1. Run `npm run build` to compile the code
1. Open `public/index.html` in a web browser
1. Click on a tile to start

## Development

While actively developing, running `npm run watch` will watch all the JS files for changes, and recompile as needed.

If TDDing, `npm run test-watch` will watch both the `src` and the `tests` folders for changes and rerun.
